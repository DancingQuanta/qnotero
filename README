ABOUT
=====
Qnotero is a sidekick to Zotero, the open-source reference manager. Zotero is an
excellent tool for managing your reference, but it lacks a simple and direct
way to search your references and open attached PDFs at the click of a button.
Qnotero lives in the system tray of your desktop and provides quick access to
your Zotero database, even if Zotero is not running.

SO WHAT HAPPENED TO GNOTERO?
============================
Qnotero is the successort to Gnotero. The name change 'G' -> 'Q' reflects that
the GUI now uses Qt4, rather than Gtk as the underlying toolkit. So, basically,
nothing bad happened to Gnotero, it just got a bit better!
